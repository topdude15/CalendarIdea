# Event Streamer

An app that helps you find things to do.


## User Story

I wake up and decide I would like to do something today.  Reviewing my day's
schedule, I find that I don't have anything scheduled for today except for
work.

So, I open the Event Streamer app **to search for things to do today.**  I
find a collection of events gathered together according to my likes.  I
would like to do something athletic, so I review the events for that
category.  I see that my friend Lili **published an event** for pickup
pickleball later today at 6pm.  I would like to do that, so I press
the event and select "Add to stream."  The app adds this event to my <span class="underline">stream</span>
<span class="underline">of events for today.</span>


### Definitions

1.  What Is A Stream?

    A <span class="underline">Stream</span> is a collection of events.  (What problems does this solve?
    Can those problems be solved with one stream? &#x2013;>) Multiple streams may exist
    parallel to each other in time.  For instance, a User may have a "Work"
    stream and a "Personal" stream with events that may occur at the same time.

2.  What Is An Event?

    An <span class="underline">Event</span> is an action taken by a User at a specific time until another
    specific time.

3.  What Is A Subscription?

    A <span class="underline">Subscription</span> is a place to which Events are published.
